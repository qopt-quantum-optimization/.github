Application Deployment
======================

We have a practical study of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to the classically hard Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences (LABS) problem. 
Using noiseless simulations of up to 40 qubits and experiments on trapped-ion quantum hardware, we show that QAOA—especially when combined with quantum minimum finding—achieves better empirical scaling than state-of-the-art classical exact solvers.
