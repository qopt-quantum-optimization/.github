Problem Encoding
================

The first step in solving an optimization problem using quantum techniques is to encode the problem into a suitable Hamiltonian.  
A single problem can be expressed through multiple encodings, each with different trade-offs in terms of qubit count, connectivity, and circuit depth.

Given the current limitations of quantum hardware — such as limited qubit counts and noise — it is essential to choose encodings that are hardware-efficient and scalable.  
To support this, we are developing a tool that automatically encodes problems in a hardware-aware manner.  
This encoding module will be made available soon.
